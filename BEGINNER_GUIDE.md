## How to Contribute or Create A Pull Request
  * Step 1: 'Fork' this repo (Top right corner). Repo is just a short from of Repository
      * Forking means a copy of this repo will be available in your account which you can edit.
  * Step 2: Go to your account (The icon with your profile picture, top right corner)
  * Step 3: Go to 'Repositories' (navigation bar, center)
      * You will find a repo named 'Write-A-program'. It is your copy of the original Write-A-Program.
  * Step 4: 'Clone' this repo if you wish to have a copy of the same on your local machine. If no go to step 5.
      * Clone a repo essential means to download a copy of the repo on your computer which you can edit, run etc.
      * This is not a necessary step, you can contribute and do PRs without cloning too.
  * Step 5: Write a Program in any programming language that you prefer on your local machine, save it as programName.lang. Eg:sum.cpp
  * Step 6: Go back to 'yourGithubUsername/Write-A-Program',then Select or Go to the respective folder
       * Select the language of your program and add your code in that particular folder 
       * If the language you are looking for is not already available, you are free to create a folder with that language name and add your files to that.
       * Different types of folders might be available for a same type of programs, if yeah add yours to those. 
       * If no and you feel like a group folder is needed for a language then add one, no worries:)
       * For example: You wrote a pattern program in c++. 
            * If no c++ folder, add a c++ folder, inside it add a pattern folder, and add your program. 
            * If there is c++ folder,but no pattern folder inside - add a pattern folder and add your program.
            * If there is a c++ folder and a pattern folder inside already add yours in to that.
  * Step 7: Now click on 'Add File'(Green box), then Upload File and drag and drop your file from your computer.
        PS: If you don't want to write the program on your computer,you can go to 'Add File'(Green box), then 'Create New File' as programName.lang and write your code
  * Step 8: Commit your code
        * Select Commit directly to the master branch option(Auto Selected). This means you are adding your changes, let them be files or errors corrections anything directly to your copy of the repo.
        * Now click on 'Commit New File'(Green Button)
  * Step 9: Pull Request(Pull Request is requesting the master repo/project maintainer to add your contribution to the original repo)
        * At 'yourGithubUsername/Write-A-Program', you will see a similar sentance: 'This branch is 1 commit ahead, 2 commits behind enchantedfirefly:master'.(The numbers can vary).
        * Pull Request and icon will be displayed after this sentance, click on that.
        * If there are no merging conflicts, it will show  'Able to merge. These branches can be automatically merged'.
        * Click on 'Create Pull Request'(Green button).
        * Add a name like added sum.cpp if it's blank. And an optional description about the changes you made.
        * Now again 'Create a Pull Request'(Green Button)
  * Step 10: There you are! You have successfully created a Pull Request. Congratulationsüéâüéâ
        * If you wanna verify this, Go to 'enchantedfirefly/Write-A-Program', Go to Pull Requests(navigation bar), and you will see your PR there.
  
Now, wait for the Project Maintainer to review and accept your pull request beofre creating another PR on the same repo.(You will get a mail and notification)
