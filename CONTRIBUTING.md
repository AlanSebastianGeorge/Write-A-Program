# Contributing
You can contribute to this repo in any of the following ways.

## Adding your program
  * Select the language of your program and add your code in that particular folder If the language you are looking for is not already available, you are free to create a folder with that language name and add your files to that.
  * Different types of folders might be available for a same type of programs, if yeah add yours to those. If no and you feel like a group folder is needed then add one, no worries:)

For example: 
    You wrote a pattern program in c++. 
        * If no c++ folder, add a c++ folder, inside it add a pattern folder, and add your program. 
        * If there is c++ folder,but no pattern folder inside - add a pattern folder and add your program 
        * If there is a c++ folder and a pattern folder inside already add yours in to that.
        
* Add your program with the appropriate name short and clear enough to recognize what your progarm is about.
* If you feel like a short simple name cannot describe your program well enough, comment the description in the beginning of the program.
      * For example, a cpp program use wrote to learn classes and inheritance might not be understandable from the short file name, hence describe what your problem or question was as a multi-line comment.

* CamelCase is preffered for file naming but if you have a different taste, then you do you.
     * (Camel case is the practice of writing phrases without spaces or punctuation, indicating the separation of words with a single capitalized letter, and the first word starting with either case.     
      * Definition source: Wikipedia)
      * For example: camelCase

* Do remember to add your file with the format fileName.lang where fileName is a short description of your program in 1-2 words and lang is the programming language you used. 
    For example: sumOfTwoNumbers.cpp or invertedTriangle.py etc.
    
## Adding solutions to existing problems
   * You can add your own version of program even if one solution already exists.
   * Name those as solution2.lang and add to the respective folder.
   
## Documentation Contributions
* You can add useful resources related to coding.
* You can improve the readme and contributing documentation.

## Issue Solving and Raising
* You can raise your Write A Program questions as issues. You will be notified once your issue is solved or a solution to your problem is added.
* Also the issues or errors you found.
* Try solving the issues and finding the errors. It's gonna help you a lot.
    
## Important Note: READ THIS BEFORE SENDING A Pull Request
   * This repo is to collect even your simplest Write A Program questions
   * If the same version of your program already exists, please try creating a new approach/solution to the same problem or try a different problem.
   * There are always hundreds of programs you can do, just a google search would give dozens of problems, write your program to solve them and add them here.
   * There won't be a time where you can't find a problem or write a rogram question, so don't worry about that :D
    
**As long as your PRs adheres to the above conditions you are all good to go**
